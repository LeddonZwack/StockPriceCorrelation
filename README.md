# StockPriceCorrelation
Hello, this program will show the user the trends and correlations between inputted stocks.
It will return a log scaled trend plot for each stock to visualize price fluctuations along with a heatmap to visualize correlation.
All data is accessed using Yahoo Finance.

I made this program with the intention of familiarizing myself with pandas while working with data in python.
